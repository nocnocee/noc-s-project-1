* Overview
    1. The clues you have collected so far, regarding the killer, has lead you to this old maze ( but, it's going to be dark and only limited filed of view is visable )
    2. First, player will have to direct themselves and look for evidence which are going to be spawned randomly through out the maze and when the player has found 50% of the evidence a Hatch will spawn randomly ( Which the player has to also find )
    3. After the player has found all of the evidence the Hatch will open up and a Killer will be spawned randomly looking for the player.
    4. The goal is to get out of the maze through the hatch without getting caught by the killer since he will stop you from getting out of the maze with those evidence.
